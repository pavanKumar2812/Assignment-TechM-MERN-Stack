Document vs document

The most common way to create an element is createElement

Where do we find this? -> Document object

step1 : console.log(document) 
        we've seen that the __proto__ of document is the HTMLDocument
step2 : console.log(window.document.constructor)
        we can conclude that the document object is constructed from the HTMLDocument constructor
step3 : console.log(window.document.nodeType)
        logs 9, which points to the DOCUMENT_NODE

we know that the HTMLDocument constructor function creates the document

The document is a DOCUMENT_NODE object which inherits from the Document node

Althrough the document node is 'theoretically' the root of the document, it isn't really...

The root of our webpage is the first Element node in the Document, which is ... the html element.

So, we can say that the HTML element is the root (top-level element) of our HTML document

When this HTML file is loaded inour browser, it becomes the document object

And Document is the ultimate node from which our document inherits from 

p.s. both Document and HTMLDocument constructors are instantiated by the browser automatically when you load 
an HTML document. Typically the use of these methods are associated with providing an HTML document to an iframe
