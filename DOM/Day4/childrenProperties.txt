                                    childNodes VS Children

                childNodes                      |         Children
-> Return a NodeList                            |    -> Returns an HTMLCollection
-> .childNodes returns all node children        |    -> .children is a property of an Element
                                                        only Elements have .children
                                                        these .children are all of type Element
