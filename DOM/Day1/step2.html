        <h3>Console Object</h3>
        <p>It gives you access to the browsers console <br>
        The Console is part of the window object <br>
        It is supplied by Browser Object Model BOM
        </p>
        <h3>
        <strong>BOM-</strong>BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
        <p>
        BOM allows Javascript to talk to the browser about things other than the  content of the page 
        <ul>
            <li>Navigator - info about browser</li>
            <li>Screen - current URL</li>
            <li>Location - info about user's screen</li>
            <li>History - info about user's history</li>
        </ul>
        There are no standards for the BOM
        <br>
        The whole HTML document is a property of the window object
