        <h3>What is the DOM - Document Object Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The DOM is built from our source HTML file</li>
            <li>The DOM is always built from valid HTML</li>
            <li>The DOM looks at our document object within our hierarchical structure</li>
            <li>Every website has a DOM</li>
            <li>This model allows Javascript(and other languages) to access elements & text</li>
            <li>The DOM is alive - we can change it with Javascript at any time</li>
            <li>The DOM is <strong>not</strong> the same as our HTML code</li>
            <li>It's <strong>not</strong> the same as the render tree, and it's not always what we see in DevTools</li>
            <li>The true DOM does not include any CSS properties (like ::before and ::after)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">There is NO WAY TO SEE THE TRUE DOM</h1>
