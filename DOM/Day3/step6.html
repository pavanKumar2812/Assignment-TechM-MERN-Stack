        <p>How we move up and down the DOM <br> It begins with understanding how family structure works </p>
        <h3><strong>Parent:</strong> A parent of any node is the node immediately above it</h3>
        <p>There are 2 main methods we can use to get the parent node</p>
        <ol>
            <li>parentNode</li>
            <li>parentElement</li>
        </ol> <br>
        <h3><strong>Child:</strong> The child of a node is the node immediately below it</h3>
        <p>Nodes beyond one level of nesting are called descendents</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Sibling:</strong> A sibling of a node is any node in the same level</h3>
        <p>Sibling nodes don't have to be of the same type</p>
